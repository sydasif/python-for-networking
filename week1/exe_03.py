3. Create three different variables the first variable should use all lower case characters with
underscore ( _ ) as the word separator. The second variable should use all upper case characters
with underscore as the word separator. The third variable should use numbers, letters, and
underscore, but still be a valid variable Python variable name.

Make all three variables be strings that refer to IPv6 addresses.

Use the from future technique so that any string literals in Python2 are unicode.
